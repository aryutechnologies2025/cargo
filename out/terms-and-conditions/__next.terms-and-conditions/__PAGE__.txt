b:T453,Please read the terms and conditions for transport of personal effects, that are a part of the agreement between Cargo Lord Ltd and its customers. Cargo Lordˇs general terms of transport apply to personal effects. Cargo Lord suggest that all personal effects shipments are insured before shipping.

In all cases must personal effects be packed securely, preferably in cardboard boxes, wrapped in corrugated cardboard or thick bubble plastic (furniture and large appliances). The corners of all large items should be specially protected. Assistance with carrying boxes/items is not included. When exporting full container loads (FCL) from Cargo Lord Ltd , the owner of the shipment is responsible for getting their cargo securely sealed before shipping. When transporting cars, personal effects cannot be kept inside the car.9:["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-lg font-bold   mb-1","children":"Terms for personal effects:"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"$b"}]]}]
